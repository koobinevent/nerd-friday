Welcome to Koobin nerd Friday, here you'll find a weekly technical exercise to sharpen your development skills. The exercise difficulty level and length will be adapted week by week depending on the progress and the engagement of the team since the goal of this is to walk together through a journey that will make us better professionals.

## How to submit an exercise?

Easy, the only thing you have to do is to **fork this repository**, then clone it and solve the exercise on your local computer. The exercises are placed under the `exercises` directory, each one will have its folder with instructions and, in some cases, a little scaffold to help you start with ease.

Before submitting, make sure that you create a branch with your name followed by the exercise number, as follows: `david-exercise-001`. Once ready, submit a PR from that branch to the master branch of this repo, the PR will never be merged, but it is a great spot to discuss the solutions and highlight the goods and the bads of each one implementation.

## I would like to improve my skills in X, can I request for an exercise?

Just open an issue with your proposal and we'll keep it into account at the time of preparing further exercises.
